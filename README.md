## 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

### 📌 Project Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. 
Utilizing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. 
the system analyzes user behavior and movie attributes to provide personalized recommendations.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise
- **Recommendation Techniques:**
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Hybrid Methods

### 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd movie_recommendation
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the recommendation system:
python main.py
🚀 Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user similarity.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies similar to those a user has liked.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies with similar content to user preferences.
